# Natural Balance? Not with me!
a Game entry for gamedev.js jam 2025 by Christoph Schansky

Nature keeps the numbers of rabbits and foxes in balance: more foxes that eat rabbits lead to less rabbits, less rabbits to eat lead to less foxes, less foxes lead to more rabbits, more rabbits lead to more foxes, and so on...

That was the natural balance for many hundred years, but thats over now, as one rebellios young rabbit refuses to be eaten by foxes. It grabs its pack of extra sharp carrots and takes measures into its own paws.
