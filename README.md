# Natural Balance? Not with me!
a Game entry for gamedev.js jam 2025 by Christoph Schansky

## Story
Nature keeps the numbers of rabbits and foxes in balance: more foxes that eat rabbits lead to less rabbits, less rabbits to eat lead to less foxes, less foxes lead to more rabbits, more rabbits lead to more foxes, and so on...

That was the natural balance for many hundred years, but thats over now, as one rebellios young rabbit refuses to be eaten by foxes. It grabs its pack of extra sharp carrots and takes measures into its own paws.

## Infos

The game is written purely in Javascript, no image-files are used for the sprites. Everything is pre-rendered at runtime. The final size of the ZIP-File is around 11.5 kilobyte.

The music and sfx are create using the magnificent tool Soundbox from https://sb.bitsnbites.eu/ 
You can also use the links in [SONGS.md](SONGS.md) to open the editor with the main-theme.

## building it on your own
If you want to run the game yourself, you either will have to use a (local) webserver and open the index.html in the src folder, or you can compile the game with "npm run build" and then just open the index.html in the build-folder (no webserver needed)
