# Natural Balance? Not with me!
a Game entry for gamedev.js jam 2025 by Christoph Schansky

Nature keeps the numbers of rabbits and foxes in balance: more foxes that eat rabbits lead to less rabbits, less rabbits to eat lead to less foxes, less foxes lead to more rabbits, more rabbits lead to more foxes, and so on...

That was the natural balance for many hundred years, but thats over now, as one rebellios young rabbit refuses to be eaten by foxes. It grabs its pack of extra sharp carrots and takes measures into its own paws.

The game is written prely in Javascript, no image-files are used for the sprites. Everything is pre-rendered at runtime.

The music and sfx are create using the magnificent tool Soundbox from https://sb.bitsnbites.eu/

If you want to run the game yourself, you either will have to use a (local) webserver and open the index.html in the src folder, or you can compile the game with "npm run build" and then just open the index.html in the build-folder (no webserver needed)
